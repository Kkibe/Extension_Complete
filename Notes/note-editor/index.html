								<br>
							</h3>
							<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
							<h3>
								<br>
								When you use any application made by us, you allow us to access certain information from your profile on that site. <br><br>The information you allow us to access may vary by application and SNS platform, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. <br><br>You can control and find out more about these settings at the SNS where you access our applications. For example, we may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:
								<br>
								1. Your First and Last Name<br>
								2. Your Profile picture or its URL<br>
								3. Your E-Mail ID<br>
								4. Your Gender<br>
								5. Your Birthday<br>
								<br><br>
								By using an application we made, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us through the SNS Application Programming Interface (“API”). <br>Your agreement takes place when you “accept” or “allow” (or similar terms) one of our applications on an SNS.
								<br><br>
								Customer Support Correspondence
								<br><br>
								When you ask for assistance, we may collect and store the contact information you provide (generally your name and e-mail address), information about your activity on the Service, and your profile picture. We may also store the correspondence and any information contained within.

								<br><br>
								When you access our websites or use our applications, we may collect (i) certain technical information about your computer system and (ii) usage statistics about your interactions with our websites and applications. This information is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies.
								<br>
							</h3>
							<h2>3. How We Collect Information about You</h2>
							<h3> <br>
								We may collect information about you in any one or more of the following ways:
								<br><br>
								Information about Users and Usage

								<br><br>
								When you use one of our applications, we collect and store certain profile information that you provide directly or through the SNS or other third party website that is offering our application(s). <br><br>To provide a richer experience, we also collect information about your usage and interaction with other user and the Service. The bulk of this information is collected and stored through the use of web logs, which are files on our web servers that record actions taken on our applications and websites.
								<br><br>
								Cookies and Automated Information Collection
								<br><br>
								When you access our websites or use our applications, we collect certain technical information in order to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and services which allows us to improve the service, (ii) provide a more personalized experience and (iii) manage advertising. <br><br>We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use server log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies, IP addresses, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of activity on our websites or applications, and other similar information. <br>In some cases, we will associate this information with your user ID number for our internal use.
								<br><br>
								We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation; (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-application settings for features like music and to track your progress on certain in-application tasks.
								<br><br>
								You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. <br><br> If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of using our applications, as our cookies are necessary to track and enhance your experience. <br><br>Please note that companies delivering advertisements in our applications or on our websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.
								<br><br>
								Other Sources
								<br><br>
								We may collect or receive information from other sources including (i) other users who choose to upload their email contacts, and (ii) third party information providers. <br><br> This information will be used to supplement your profile – primarily to help you and your friends connect. It will be combined with other information we collect.
								<br>
							</h3>
							<h2>4. How We Use the Information We Collect</h2><br>
							<h3>
								In general, we collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. For example, we may use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:
								<br><br>
								1. To register your account and allow use of our applications<br>
								2. To administer applications and user experience<br>
								3. To identify and suggest connections with other users<br>
								4. To enable user-to-user communications<br>
								5. To provide technical support and respond to user inquiries<br>
								6. To prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service<br>
								7. To notify users of in-app updates<br>
								8. To provide leader boards and promote in-app achievements<br>
								9. To communicate about new and current content, products and services<br>
								10. To solicit input and feedback to improve our products and services and <br>customize your user experience
								11. To resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems<br>
								12. To analyze trends and user traffic and gather statistical information<br>
								13. To inform users about new products or promotional offers
								<br><br>
								One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to us, we'll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your in-app activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-app status such as “new story update” as well as notifications of badges and other requests. <br> We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (“Promotional Communications”) directly or in partnership with parties other than us.
								<br><br>
								You always have the choice to stop receiving Promotional Communications. When you receive Promotional Communications from us you will have the opportunity to “opt out” by (i) following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the Promotional Communication you receive or (ii) by editing your preferences. <br><br>Please note that despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may still send you administrative messages regarding our applications, including, for example, administrative confirmations, and notices of updates to our Policies. For more information on your messaging options see “Your Sharing and Messaging Options” below.
								<br>
							</h3>
							<h2>5. Sharing of Your Information</h2><br>
							<h3>
								We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, that is parties other than us, in the following circumstances:
								<br><br>
								Third Party Service Providers
								<br><br>
								We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our behalf, which may include payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to assist us in our marketing efforts. <br> We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on our behalf.
								<br><br>
								Friends and Other Users
								<br><br>
								In some of our applications other users will be able to see your name or profile. Your profile may include your profile photo, which in certain cases can reveal your User ID number. <br><br>Access to this information may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS account.
								<br><br>
								Advertising of Third-Party Products and Services
								<br><br>
								We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent. <br><br> If we wish to share in this fashion, we will ask for your consent. Advertisers, however, may obtain public information about you from your profile or other public sources.
								<br><br>
								We may use and share with third parties certain technical information (including IP addresses) or aggregated information to show general demographic and preference information among users. <br><br>We may also allow advertisers to collect technical or aggregated information, which they may share with us, with tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. <br> <br>The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). <br> <br>To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website.
								<br><br>
								Our collection, use, and disclosure of anonymous and aggregated information are not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy.

Many SNS allow you to control how you share information with third-party applications and websites, such as our applications, through your privacy settings on each SNS. <br> <br>We do not control what privacy settings those sites make available to their users, so we refer you to the privacy policies that are posted on those sites to learn what options they make available to their users.
