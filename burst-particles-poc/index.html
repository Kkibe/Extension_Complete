   I wanted some particles for a project to give it some pzazz - I didn't want it to be JS heavy as I will already have things going on, so the animations are entirely CSS - just using JS to initialise and activate.
   These particle sources will be placed under objects.

   The particles are constructed from a stem which rotates 30 degrees (the wrapper is set at a random angle so the 30 degree animation is in a random orientation) at a random speed and when activated the particle will move the length of the moving stem making the particle so it wiggles around. Particles are split into 4 and the first group has no delay but a longer animation and the others have a delay - so the particles you first see you can follow and see the whole animation as they disappear last, and the others give a longer lasting volume.

   Particle sources can be edited:
      [particle-count]    - how many particles it will make
      [particle-distance] - maximum reach of the particles between 10% and 100% of the given value
      [particle-color]    - comma seperated colours
   (Add .particle-do to start the animation)

   Edit: I really didn't need to say any of that stuff, you aren't an idiot

   TIL that "pzazz" is spelt that way
